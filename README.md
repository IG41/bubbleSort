# üìö Bubble Sort in Multiple Languages

Simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in different programming languages.
## About

This repo demonstrates how to implement the classic **Bubble Sort** algorithm in various languages.  
Each implementation sorts an array of integers in **ascending order** using nested loops.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a **study project** to demonstrate the Bubble Sort algorithm in multiple programming languages.  
It is **not optimized for performance or production use**.
